The age of AI is upon us – innovative technologies are appearing, and industries are starting to change rapidly. While these advances from AI are diverse in form and function, they all stand upon the same foundational concepts. This article will cover the three fundamental concepts to successfully approach business problems in the age of AI.

## 1. Predictions

AI is software that uses predictions. AI predicts spam emails to keep them out of your inbox. In your industry, a prediction might be a patient's chance of having a heart attack, the rate of business growth, or if a school will need intervention to improve student outcomes.

You then need to do something with that prediction, whether it is alert a nurse via an app, hire more staff, or ignore the prediction as it was not actionable.

>
> ##### *"What are you trying to predict?"*

## 2. Industry expertise

An AI practitioner might build a solution that predicts whether a patient will have a heart attack within the next 12 hours, but in practice that information might not be actionable. Or heart attacks are not the highest priority, and investigating sepsis predictions should come first.

Finding the right thing to predict is asking the right question, such as "will a patient have a heart attack within the next 4 hours?" and "is there a greater than 99% chance this transaction is fraudulent?"

It is vital that domain experts work with AI practitioners to produce the right questions.

An AI practitioner can build the predictive tools, but domain experts must help guide those tools so adequate ROI is produced. Data and people are variable, so both must work together to fine tune the predictive tools to improve value creation.

> ### Key question
>
> ##### *"How will this use case provide value in our industry?"*

## 3. Data

The better the data, the better the predictions. Industry experts will know what data is obtainable, relevant, and reliable. AI practitioners will know how the data should be stored, structured, and the minimum amount of data required.

As predictive models are trained using historical data, the structure of the data must stay consistent. This is vital. You can't train a model using examples with 50 different data points, only to give the model 70, or to change how you measure your number of users.

You can always retrain predictive models with better data. If you have a good data strategy, you can automatically train new predictive models when new data becomes available, and deploy the models into production if they supply better performance.

> ##### *"What data is obtainable, and will the data structure stay consistent?"*

## Summary

You do not need to be an AI expert to achieve success with AI. Rather, you need to knowledge specific to your industry, and know how to strategically approach improving business processes with AI. Asking the right questions will help you find the right technology partner to make your projects successful.

Often, you will see references to AI-models, machine learning models, and deep learning models. They all mean the same thing – predictive models. Also, the prediction itself is also known as a 'label', and each data point that is sent to the predictive model is known as a 'feature'.
